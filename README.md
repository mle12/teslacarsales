 To use Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques to make predictions about which Tesla Car models will sell more in the future. I used the Python programming language and various libraries including Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to load, wrangle and clean large datasets of car sales by make and model. I then visualised the data using Seaborn and then fit various linear regression models to make predictions about future car sales. I found that a Random Forest Regressor made the best predictions about which car make and models would be more likely to sell in the future.
